# Deep Learning - Image Classification

Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Program - Project 2: Classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

In this project, I classified images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. The dataset is preprocessed, then a convolutional neural network is trained on all the samples. I normalized the images, one-hot encoded the labels, built a convolutional layer, max pool layer, and fully connected layer. At then end, I present their predictions on the sample images.
