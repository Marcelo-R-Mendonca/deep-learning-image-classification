# deep-learning-image-classification
In this project, I classified images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. The dataset is preprocessed, then a convolutional neural network is trained on all the samples. I normalized the images, one-hot encoded the labels, built a convolutional layer, max pool layer, and fully connected layer. At then end, I present their predictions on the sample images.
